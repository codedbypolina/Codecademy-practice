### 💪🏼 Progress:

In this section I am going to share my progress, thoughts and challenges throughout the course.

#### ✓  Data types, built-in methods, and variables.
- This introduction to JS was very easy to go through since I already have a good idea of these concepts
- It was interesting to learn that `.` is an operator itself, known as <em>dot operator</em>
- I wasn't aware of <em>symbol</em> data type that is used in more complex coding
